The app was launched on November 2009 by [**Jan Koum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Koum) **and** [**Brian Acton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Acton)**.**  The two buddies created it from the idea of not missing calls while in the gym.

In 2014 Facebook acquired WhatsApp for **$19 Billion.** Acton would later leave the company to co-found [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)).

WhatsApp was only available on **iOS** at the time of launch and on other devices in later versions. Today it has evolved to be secure and fast maintaining its End-to-End encryption feature. Others being:
