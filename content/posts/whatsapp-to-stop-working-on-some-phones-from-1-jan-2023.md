As WhatsApp support states, this is actually normal as the application is developed to run on the current systems. This is what the meta support team had to say:

> "Devices and software change often, so we regularly review what operating systems we support and make updates," it says on the [support website](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1150261202542208/?helpref=hc_fnav).
>
> "Every year, like other technology companies, we look at which devices and software are the oldest and have the fewest number of people still using them.
>
> "These devices also might not have the latest security updates, or might lack the functionality required to run WhatsApp."
