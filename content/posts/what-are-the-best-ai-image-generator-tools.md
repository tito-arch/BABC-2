Artificial intelligence is becoming popular nowadays with different types of Ai being released in the market which are actually accessible to anyone in the world as long as you have your phone or computer. Nowadays, it's very difficult to recognize what is made by Ai and a human. especially art which for the longest time humans have been known to create some of the most stunning art. One example is Mona Lisa, which despite being drawn a century ago we still value. And still, people from all walks of the world fly all the way to the **gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris** museum just to see Monalisa's art.

But personally, if I were to be asked Monalisa's art usually receives a lot of unnecessary attention maybe because of its artist Leonard DaVinci who was best known to hide messages in his art maybe that's why. But one shocking fact is that today using the right prompts and Ai tools you can be able to create Monalisa's art within minutes with all the details and everything check this out.

But today we are not going to look at history art but more on Ai art. When I say AI art this is a broad term that needs to be broken into small pieces so that we can understand everything.

# What are Ai image generators?

Ai image generators are basically software programs that have been programmed to create art by entering a prompt of what you want to create.

## How do these Ai generators work?

As the name suggests, these AI generators are basically trained models used to create art. These models use text input from the user and through machine learning and neural networks processes the input to generate different variations of the image.

## How can I use these image generator tools?

Since the data used to train these models is huge this makes them produce unique content every time you generate an image hence they are now used by artists and fashion designers to come up with unique styles of art.

Others may just use these generators to simply create an avatar for their business artwork for their office etc. but due to the high demand for these models there are many different of them on the internet each with different capabilities and weaknesses also so if you are feeling confused on the best art generator worry no more

### [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)

DALL-E 2 was introduced to the public on **November 2022** and since then it has gained a lot of popularity due to its capability to produce accurate creative high quality pictures. by just entering the text and clicking run.

DALLE-2 will produce multiple options which you can choose from, you can even run it again for refining. What makes dalle-2 stand out is its simple-to-use interface where you can even remove the background or crop the image to your liking before uploading.

and yeah as the name suggests this is version 2 of dalle-1. but this version 2 has come with some great improvements which were not there before.in Dalle-2 you can also upload an image from your computer. And adding some text inputs on how you want to modify the picture is what makes dalle 2 stand out among the rest generators. Some of the creations of Dalle-2 include:

### [Stable diffusion](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/)

stable diffusion was developed by stabilityAi with EleutherAI and LAION, this is the simplest to use with its fast accessibility feature and also the best option for newbies who want to crate AI art for the first time. one major drawback to this AI generator is the size and quality of the output image. Where they only produce a small-sized image, but with the beta version of Stable Diffusion it is able to produce high-quality 512x512 pixel images.some of the images created using Stable Diffusion:

### [jasper.a.i](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwis14e0lYH9AhUKkGgJHfMiABEYABAAGgJ3Zg&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbOD2ZeyvyuoIL7GxboPrPea5-sQ2S0Xq5-E1Wo1gJdomky9EJ3fYN5rxEHTairasgR9ul0IYUwlcEZVkp4X9q3qf9YVTdHn4e_aYAlMR2Pr9e0izEHYnRGAubnu45kC6-LSjC9bcLDLJqV2qOw&sig=AOD64_0lezyC6uk27pr_oOEz1FYbiJxwaQ&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjM7oC0lYH9AhUCXqQEHbayAs8Q0Qx6BAgJEAE)

If you are looking for a generator that will give you high-quality images for personal or even commercial use, then jasper AI should be your first option. This tool is mostly used by graphic designers to create stunning art while others use it to get ideas. jasper ai is actually very simple to use, and you don't even have to have any design experience in order to use its beginner-friendly and most of all its the best high-quality image generator. You can also use it to create website designs, business advertisements, and more. Let me show you some art I created by using jasper AI.

### [Night cafe](https://nightcafe.studio/)

Night cafe is unique among all the other AI generators due to its ability to create art in specific art styles. Some popular art styles include “**oil painting**,” “**cubist,**” “**fantasy,**” or “**3D game**.” which when used well with certain keyword prompts can give you very stunning outputs. Also with night cafe, you can be able to make videos. even if its not as high-quality videos as you would produce with our normal camera We can say its an improvemnt considering that the video is generated from shallow text input and with that only it's able to produce very creative art. But a major drawback for night cafe is that its not free like other generators you are even limited to produce. Only five arts and if you want to continue a **$7.99** dollar charge is charged. for us who like free things, this is a major disappointment.

Some of night cafe generated images are:

### [Midjourney ](https://midjourney.com/)

When it comes to creating photo realistic AI images, especially faces which are very difficult to produce with other generators, then mid-journey is the best. Many people usually use mid-journey to create celebrity faces or even try to create imaginative art.

Unlike other models, mid-journey is operated through a discord server. Where every art you create is stored there, with options such as download and share your creations. Discord bots are used to refine the picture and produce a very high-quality images with different artistic styles after producing you a can also choose the best image produced or even refine it with the options given. Also, mid-journey you can make approximately 25 free photos for free. After that, you must purchase a full membership to continue to use it.

The best part is that you can join a workspace and learn how others are producing their art and get inspired by others. After producing you can showcase your work or even sell it, as with everything you produce you are actually allowed to own it. 

You will also be shocked to realize there are artists on Fiverr who sell that service of creating art using mid-journey therefore Ai art generators are a source of income to many.

### [Craiyon (Formerly DALL-E mini)](https://www.craiyon.com/)

This is my favorite Ai generator as it is free to use and it's actually accessible to anyone by just visiting their website. unlike Dalle, craiyon is a little bit slow in terms of speed but so you need to be patient while using craiyon, I have used dalle-2 and Stable Diffusion before and found that they are both similar in that they are censored so you can't just put any prompt. But with craiyon you are granted all the freedom in the world to put the prompt you want and with this kind of freedom, the end result is limitless like you can create anything that is in your mind. And you are added the advantage of creating a specific style of art a feature you only get with night cafe Check out this Craiyon Ai image generated:

### [Pixray](https://pixray.gob.io/)

Pixray is a go-to tool for all developers due to its ability to provide APIs that you can use on your own website or project.

A fun fact is that Pixray is free to use. also you may think that Pixray is only for tech-savvy people, but **no**. Pixray website has the simplest and beginner-friendly interface. The best part is that while generating you can see everything as it's being created, right there on the website, so you get an idea of what actually happens in the backend. I must say this was a good and unique touch that Pixray deployed. Also, when you head to settings that's where the fun begins you are given the freedom to transform your picture into different styles, still you can convert them into videos and edit them in the most creative manner with all the required tools being there and remember you get to watch everything as its happening something you don't get with this other generators.

### [Starry Ai](https://www.starryai.com/)

With starry AI you are limited to only produce images for night sky images as the name suggests. Since starry AI does not create that complicated images you are only required to use a very short prompt of what you want to create. Very easy to use and produces very dramatic skies and stars. a go-to tool for photoshop users and graphic designers i found this wonderful image created by starry AI:
