# What are digital number plates?

These are next-generation vehicle identification devices mounted on car bumpers that emit radio signals to provide tracking information and additional data.

We have seen a lot of technologies being used on our roads to aid fight against breaking the national transport laws including [cameras](https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/speeding/speedcameras/howdo_theywork.html) installed along the **Ksh 32 billion (US$360 million)** Thika Superhighway or sophisticated [**radar guns **](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_speed_gun)that get you pulled over.

Ever wondered how KENHA intelligence identifies all trucks that could be above a certain mass captures the number plate and displays it on an LED screen with instructions (**_KDD 405Z <EXIT_**) to filter which vehicles to be inspected on the weighing bridge?

### The security features include:

This will help monitor motor vehicles within and across the borders which have proven to be difficult as the number has increased from 3.2 to now 4.8 million in two years.

* Unique QR (quick response) code.
* Unique laser etched NTSA serial number.
* Hot stamped chromium-based hologram.
* An in-built microchip is accessible by authorities remotely.
* Same font size.

some features will not be visible to the naked eye deliberately done to ensure that the information will not be altered eg. an (RFID) Radio Frequency Identification microchip to aid the transfer of information to authorities. All automobiles on highways will leave footprints.

Production of these identification plates will be done by the government to ensure seamless workflow and strictly not offer tenders to curb inflated prices. This will be done at the Recce squad headquarters at Ruiru.

###### Advantages and disadvantages.

1. It will be easy to recover stolen vehicles.
2. It will be easy for traffic control to monitor, collect and make data-driven decisions.
3. It will cause a significant decrease in crime since it will be easy to recover all data eg.   _which car passed a specific route at a specific time curbing abduction and theft incidences._
4. It will reduce the tax evasion crisis since plates will be issued at the port of entry.
5. The plates have a modern design and are appealing.

All these advantages don't come with at least one disadvantage which in **my opinion** who wants the government always on their track. When we spy or eavesdrop on someone, **_we are trying to gain information that is not being willingly shared with us._** Some people are not ready for this but we can live with that that is if you run errands that are top secret like building the Next google. To those feeling being spayed is not on their to-do list here is a quote for you.
