Everyone is going to agree with me when I say WhatsApp is the best messaging app to chat with friends and family. One reason is that **it's free**, **it's decentralized**, **it's secure** as all the conversations are _end-to-end encrypted_ and the best part of all it has **no ads**. which makes our life simpler since you can chat securely. 

Without having to worry about those annoying ads every now and then or even being redirected to unknown URLs, we can say WhatsApp has come a long way. Last year we were introduced to **communities**, which are a great way to organize related groups. You can read the full article on  [WhatApp new features 2022](https://www.bunnieabc.com/posts/what-s-app-new-features-2022/) it was not long before we were introduced to WhatsApp avatars, which are a new personalized way to express yourself. I have already covered that topic on[ WhatsApp Avatars](https://www.bunnieabc.com/posts/whatsapp-new-features-2023/) Just to be on the safe side make sure you read both of them before reading this. But that aside, for now, let's focus on recent features. 

Whatsapp **status** has been the same you either share **photo**s or even share a **video**. but with the recent update which was officially announced on **Feb 7, 2023.** Whatsapp status has received a lot of attention with a few improvements, which for the longest time people have been waiting for, some even upgraded to GB WhatsApp which offers more features. Let's have a look at some of the features and upgrades that WhatsApp status has received.

# Link with Image Previews

If you have ever sent a link to someone. and wished that maybe the link would look a little bit nicer or maybe a new format like an image that shows what to expect on the other side. Don't worry you are not alone. Maybe in the **future**, we are going to see this implementation..... no am just kidding, the time is now. You don't have to be worried about opening **_spam links_** that will take you to unknown websites before clicking a link an image preview will be provided.

This feature can be seen in the chat section and status also, and you know what this means. **_Marketers_** who sell their products online can now be selling their products and provide a link that shows the client what to expect on the other side.

## Private Audience Selector

Due to many personal reasons, you may want to hide your status from specific people wondering how? Don't worry since with the recent update you can now confidently do that all you have to do is to head to setting to privacy and then status, where you will be provided with three options, either choose **my contacts,** **my except,** or **only share with** specific people. One thing to keep in mind is that when you choose to only share your status with specific contacts, the setting will be saved as the **_default._**

## Voice Status 

This is my favorite out of all. Because most of the time you may want to quickly send a voice note to your friends, or maybe you want your message to have a correct tone you don't have to worry anymore since WhatsApp has introduced voice messages in status.

Now you can send voice notes to alert friends and family about anything rather than spending all the time in the world typing or searching for an image or a video that matches your message. Making our interactions simpler.The only limit is you can only send a 30 seconds recorded audio.but a great life hack would be sending many 30 seconds recorded audios which can be a little bit frustrating for listeners. Lets hope Whatsapp will increase the time span in their coming updates. another feature we hope to see is the download option for videos and images in the status section.
## Status Reactions

After being requested for a while, finally, status reactions are here with us. Remember, first we saw this feature on the chat page only, but now you can efficiently compliment a friend or react using the default 8 emojis by tapping once and just like that the reaction emoji is sent. Make sure you don't tap twice or overdo it.

## Status Profile Rings 

First, we saw this feature in GB WhatsApp Remember all the other WhatsApp other than the official normal whatsapps are not recommended as you risk your account being banned by WhatsApp or even your personal data may be stolen. Remember there is no customer support for this type of application, so to be on the safe side use the recommended WhatsApp always. which actually is better, and you can be sure that your data is secure.

When someone updates their status, you will be notified with a green ring along the profile picture, and you can click to directly view the status. With this feature, you are assured of being updated on everything that gets posted.
